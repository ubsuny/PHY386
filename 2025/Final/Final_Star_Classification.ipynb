        "In this project, you will analyze a FITS image of a star field to classify stars based on their color. By measuring the brightness of stars in different filters, you will determine their color indices and relate them to **spectral classes** (e.g., O, B, A, F, G, K, M). You will explore how star colors relate to their temperatures and physical properties.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Load the FITS image and inspect its contents.\n",
        "- Display the image with appropriate scaling to visualize the star field.\n",
        "- Identify and label several stars for analysis.\n",
        "- Generate histograms of pixel values to assess brightness distribution.\n",
        "- **Note:** Focus on stars that are part of the star cluster to ensure consistent distance and age assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Task 2: Physical Context and Research (3 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explain the concept of color indices (e.g., B-V) and their significance in determining stellar temperatures.\n",
        "- Discuss the relationship between color indices and spectral classification.\n",
        "- Explore how different stellar populations (e.g., main sequence, giants) exhibit distinct color characteristics.\n",
        "- **Importance for Star Clusters:** Understanding color indices is crucial for analyzing star clusters, as they allow astronomers to infer the age, composition, and evolutionary state of the cluster. Since stars in a cluster are at approximately the same distance and formed around the same time, their color indices can reveal insights into the cluster's properties and history.\n",

        "- Use the **SIMBAD catalog** to retrieve the **spectral classifications** of the same stars.\n",
        "- Compare your calculated color indices with the spectral classifications from SIMBAD to assess consistency.\n",
        "- Plot color-magnitude diagrams to visualize the distribution of stars.\n",
